# Product Recommendation Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze user preferences and behaviors using the Amazon product reviews dataset to create a recommendation system. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system will provide personalized product suggestions based on user interactions. The goal is to improve user experience by helping them discover products that match their interests.

## Process
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - The dataset was downloaded from [Amazon product reviews dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/), containing user reviews, product details, and ratings.

2. **Data Exploration**: 
   - The data was loaded and examined for structure, missing values, and overall quality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution of ratings, identify popular products, and analyze user activity.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning steps were taken to remove duplicates and handle missing values. Relevant features were selected for further analysis, and text data was prepared for modeling if necessary.

4. **Recommendation Model Selection**: 
   - Based on the analysis, the appropriate recommendation algorithms were chosen (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach).

5. **Model Implementation**: 
   - The selected algorithms were implemented in Python using libraries such as `scikit-learn` and `lightfm`.

6. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - The performance of the recommendation system was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and precision/recall to ensure accuracy and relevance of recommendations.

7. **Results Documentation**: 
   - Findings from the analysis and model evaluation were documented, highlighting key insights and the effectiveness of the recommendation system.

## Findings
- **Dataset Overview**: The dataset consists of user reviews for various products, including user IDs, product IDs, ratings, and review texts.
- **Distribution of Ratings**: The analysis revealed a typical distribution of ratings, with most ratings concentrated around 4 and 5 stars, indicating positive user experiences.
- **Most Reviewed Products**: A small number of products received a significant portion of the reviews, suggesting that certain products are more popular or well-known among users.
- **User Activity**: A few users contributed a large number of reviews, indicating varying levels of engagement across the user base.

## Installation
To set up the environment and install dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Exploration**: Run the `eda.py` script to perform exploratory data analysis and visualize key metrics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Use the `data_preprocessing.py` script to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Model Implementation**: Implement your recommendation model in `model.py`.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your model using the `evaluation.py` script.
